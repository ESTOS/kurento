Kurento JavaScript Tutorial
===========================
Kurento Client JavaScript demos

This project contains a set of simple applications built with JavaScript
Kurento Client APIs (kurento-client-js and kurento-utils-js).

The source code of this project can be cloned from the [GitHub repository].

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Be sure to have installed [Node.js] in your system:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
Also be sure to have installed [Bower] in your system:

```bash
sudo npm install -g bower
```

Each demo is located in a single folder (e.g. kurento-hello-world, kurento-magic-mirror,
and so on). For example, to launch the kurento-hello-world demo, run:

```bash
cd kurento-hello-world
bower install
```

An HTTP server is required for these demos. A very simple way of doing this is by
means of a NodeJS server. This server can be installed as follows:

```bash
sudo npm install http-server -g
```

Then, in each demo folder execute this command:

```bash
http-server
```

Finally, open this URL in your browser: http://localhost:8080/

Take into account that demos with Generators (FaceOverlayGenerator,
RecorderFilterGenerator, and so on) require [co] (generator based
flow-control for nodejs). In these demos, the experimental JavaScript
support must be enabled. In Chrome, this can done in this configuration page:

chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony
