====================
Client API Reference
====================

Currently, the Kurento project provides implementations of the :doc:`/features/kurento_protocol` for two programming languages: *Java* and *JavaScript*.

In the future, additional Kurento Clients can be created, exposing the same kind of modularity in other languages such as Python, C/C++, PHP, etc.



Java Client
===========

**Kurento Java Client** is a Java SE layer which consumes the Kurento API and exposes its capabilities through a simple-to-use interface based on Java POJOs representing Media Elements and Media Pipelines. Using the Kurento Java Client only requires adding the appropriate dependency to a *Maven* project or to download the corresponding *jar* into the application's *Java Classpath*.

* **Reference**: `Kurento Client JavaDoc <../_static/client-javadoc/index.html>`__.



JavaScript Client
=================

**Kurento JavaScript Client** is a JavaScript layer which consumes the Kurento API and exposes its capabilities to JavaScript developers. It allow to build *Node.js* and browser-based applications.

* **Reference**: `Kurento Client JsDoc <../_static/client-jsdoc/index.html>`__.



Kurento Js Utils
================

`kurento-utils-js <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-utils-js>`__ is a browser library that can be used to simplify creation and handling of `RTCPeerConnection <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection>`__ objects, to control the browser's `WebRTC API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API>`__.
