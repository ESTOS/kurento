==============

This demo shows how to record your desktop from your browser using Kurento. Due
to security restrictions in Chrome, this needs that all the content is served
using a secure HTTPS web server, so one is included build in Node.js. To run
this demo, please first exec ```npm install``` to instal all the Node.js and
Bower dependencies, and later start the server by executing ```npm start```.
